# Contributing to OpenVINO Windows LLM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenVINO Windows LLM! We welcome all contributions, including bug fixes, documentation improvements, feature requests, and code enhancements.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

---

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and welcoming to all community members in issue trackers, pull requests, and discussion areas.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
First, fork this repository on GitHub, and then clone your fork locally:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/openvino-windows-llm.git
cd openvino-windows-llm
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment
Run the first-time setup script. If you plan to convert models, use the `-WithConvert` flag:

```powershell
# Runtime server dependencies only:
.\setup.bat

# With model-conversion tools (requires optimum-intel):
.\setup.bat -WithConvert
```

This will create a Python virtual environment under `.venv/` and install all required packages.

### 3. Run the Development Server
You can run the server in **Mock Mode** on any operating system (including macOS and Linux) to develop or test the API/UI without requiring Intel hardware:

```powershell
.\start_server.bat --mock
```

To run with a real OpenVINO model on Intel hardware (CPU/GPU/NPU):

```powershell
.\start_server.bat --model <model-id> --device NPU
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Testing
We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for automated testing. Our test suite runs against the mock engine, meaning you do not need Intel hardware to run and pass the tests.

1. Install development dependencies:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
2. Run the tests:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
   ```

All tests should be green before submitting a pull request.

### Code Style and Formatting
We follow PEP 8 and enforce clean formatting.
We use **ruff** for formatting and linting. Make sure to check and format your code before pushing:

```powershell
# Run lint check
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff check .

# Apply automatic fixes / formatting
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff format .
```

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature
   ```
2. **Implement changes** and add unit tests under the `tests/` directory if you're writing new functionality.
3. **Verify** that `ruff check .` runs clean and `pytest` passes.
4. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message.
5. **Push** to your fork and **open a Pull Request** against the main repository.
