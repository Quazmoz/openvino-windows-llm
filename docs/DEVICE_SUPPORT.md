# Device Support Notes

This project is Windows-first. Linux support is experimental and currently supports Ubuntu and Fedora.

## Target Matrix

| Platform | CPU | GPU | NPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | Supported | Supported if OpenVINO sees it | Primary target with compatible Intel hardware/drivers |
| Ubuntu experimental | Basic target | Experimental and driver-dependent | Experimental and driver-dependent |
| Fedora experimental | Basic target | Experimental and driver-dependent | Experimental and driver-dependent |

## Device Discovery

Device visibility is ultimately determined by:

```bash
python -m app.server --check-devices
```

On Windows, you can use:

```powershell
.\start_server.bat --check-devices
```

On Linux, you can use:

```bash
./start_server.sh --check-devices
```

If OpenVINO does not list a device, the app cannot use it. `lspci`, Device Manager, or other system tools can provide useful hints, but OpenVINO discovery is the source of truth for this server.

## Device Modes

The server passes device strings to OpenVINO GenAI. Common examples:

```text
CPU
GPU
NPU
AUTO
AUTO:NPU,GPU,CPU
AUTO:GPU,NPU,CPU
MULTI:NPU,GPU,CPU
HETERO:NPU,GPU,CPU
```

`MULTI` and `HETERO` are experimental routing modes. They may help some workloads, but they do not promise faster single-prompt generation or additive multi-device performance.

## Hardware Benchmarking

Use the benchmark feature to measure a converted catalog model on your own machine before choosing a default device:

```powershell
python -m app.server --benchmark --benchmark-model tinyllama-1.1b-chat-fp16 --benchmark-devices CPU,GPU,NPU,AUTO
```

Composite device strings contain commas, so use semicolons when listing several targets:

```powershell
python -m app.server --benchmark --benchmark-model tinyllama-1.1b-chat-fp16 --benchmark-devices "CPU;GPU;NPU;AUTO;AUTO:NPU,GPU,CPU"
```

You can also run the standalone module:

```powershell
python -m runtime.benchmark_runner --benchmark-model tinyllama-1.1b-chat-fp16 --benchmark-devices "CPU;AUTO:NPU,GPU,CPU"
```

The API and web UI expose the same runner:

```text
POST   /v1/benchmarks/run
GET    /v1/benchmarks
GET    /v1/benchmarks/latest
DELETE /v1/benchmarks
```

Results are saved under `benchmark/results/benchmarks.json` by default and that directory is gitignored. Set `OV_LLM_BENCHMARK_RESULTS` to move the JSON file.

The recommendation score prefers successful runs, lower first-token latency, higher tokens/sec, lower total latency, and reasonable load time. Treat it as a practical local hint, not a hardware guarantee. `AUTO`, `MULTI`, and `HETERO` are routing modes; they are not guaranteed to beat a direct `CPU`, `GPU`, or `NPU` target for every model or prompt.

In mock mode, benchmark results validate the server/UI flow only. Rerun on Windows with OpenVINO and converted model files for a real hardware recommendation. Ubuntu and Fedora remain experimental; validate CPU first, then test GPU/NPU only after OpenVINO lists those devices.
