# API Contract

OpenVINO Windows LLM implements a practical subset of the OpenAI API plus local model,
device, benchmark, and diagnostics routes. The contract is tested in mock mode by CI and
can be certified against real Windows hardware with `scripts/validate_windows.ps1`.

## Compatibility levels

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Mock contract | Route, schema, streaming, lifecycle, and error behavior tested without OpenVINO hardware. |
| Real CPU certified | A Windows report completed with mock mode disabled on CPU. |
| Real GPU certified | A Windows report completed on an OpenVINO-visible Intel GPU. |
| Real NPU certified | A Windows report completed on an OpenVINO-visible Intel NPU. |
| Client verified | The actual external client was manually connected in addition to black-box contract validation. |

A mock contract result is not evidence that a driver or hardware target works.

## OpenAI-compatible routes

### `GET /v1/models`

Returns an OpenAI-style model list. Local status is included as an additional field.

### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Supported request fields:

- `model`
- `messages`
- `max_tokens`
- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `stream`
- `stream_options.include_usage`
- `stop` as a string or array
- `seed`
- `tools`
- `tool_choice`
- `response_format`
- `lora_path`
- `lora_alpha`

Streaming uses Server-Sent Events with `chat.completion.chunk` payloads and terminates
with `data: [DONE]`.

Tool calling is implemented with a prompt and parser shim because OpenVINO GenAI does
not provide native OpenAI tool-call semantics. Whether a model reliably emits a valid
call depends on the model and prompt. Malformed calls receive bounded retry handling.

`response_format` is passed to OpenVINO structured-output support when the installed
OpenVINO GenAI version exposes it. Older versions or unsuitable models may accept the
request without producing strict JSON. The certification report records that as a
warning rather than claiming schema enforcement.

Dynamic LoRA and speculative decoding depend on the installed OpenVINO GenAI version
and compatible model artifacts. They are API-supported but require separate real-runtime
validation for each adapter or draft-model combination.

### `POST /v1/responses`

Supported fields:

- `model`
- `input` as text or message-like input
- `instructions`
- `max_output_tokens`
- `temperature`
- `stream`
- `lora_path`
- `lora_alpha`

Non-streaming responses return an OpenAI-style response object. Streaming emits:

- `response.created`
- `response.output_text.delta`
- `response.output_text.done`
- `response.completed`
- `data: [DONE]`

This route is the recommended compatibility path for n8n workflows that use the
Responses API.

### `POST /v1/embeddings`

Supported fields:

- `model`
- `input` as one string or a list of strings
- `encoding_format` as `float` or `base64`
- `user` accepted for client compatibility

The selected model must use the `openvino-embeddings` backend. Text-generation models
are rejected, and embedding models are rejected by generation routes.

## Local management routes

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v1/models/register` | Add a custom catalog entry. |
| `GET` | `/v1/models/search-hf` | Search compatible Hugging Face models. |
| `POST` | `/v1/models/download-custom` | Register, convert, and optionally load a custom model. |
| `POST` | `/v1/models/convert` | Convert a catalog model in the background. |
| `POST` | `/v1/models/load` | Load a converted model on a selected device. |
| `POST` | `/v1/models/unload` | Free a loaded engine. |
| `POST` | `/v1/models/delete` | Delete an unloaded model's local IR directory. |
| `GET` | `/v1/devices` | Return OpenVINO discovery and device suggestions. |
| `GET` | `/v1/system/status` | Return telemetry, lifecycle progress, metrics, and recent safe events. |
| `GET` | `/v1/keys/stats` | Return per-key usage counters without exposing keys. |
| `POST` | `/v1/benchmarks/run` | Benchmark model/device combinations. |
| `GET` | `/v1/benchmarks` | List locally persisted benchmark runs. |
| `GET` | `/v1/benchmarks/latest` | Return the latest run and recommendation. |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/benchmarks` | Clear saved benchmark runs. |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/export` | Export a supplied conversation as Markdown. |

Model conversion and loading are asynchronous. Clients should poll
`/v1/system/status` and inspect the matching catalog entry until `is_loaded` is true or
an error state is returned.

## Health routes

- `GET /health` returns process, runtime, device, and model-count state.
- `GET /health/live` is an unauthenticated liveness probe.
- `GET /health/ready` returns 503 while model preparation is active and 200 otherwise.

Health routes remain available without an API key so local supervisors can check the
process. `/v1/*` routes are protected when `OV_LLM_API_KEY` is set.

## Authentication, CORS, and rate limiting

Set one or more comma-separated keys with `OV_LLM_API_KEY`. Protected requests must
send:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <key>
```

Repeated failed authentication attempts are throttled. Keys are compared using a
constant-time comparison and are not returned by usage endpoints.

`OV_LLM_CORS_ORIGINS` defaults to `*`. Set explicit comma-separated origins for a
browser client on another origin. Credentialed CORS is enabled only with explicit
origins.

`OV_LLM_RATE_LIMIT` applies a per-IP requests-per-minute limit when greater than zero.
It is a local safety control, not a replacement for a hardened reverse proxy.

## Error behavior

The server uses conventional status codes:

- `400` invalid request, device expression, model/backend pairing, or conversion option
- `401` missing or invalid API key
- `404` unknown model
- `409` model is unloaded, busy, loading, or in a conflicting lifecycle state
- `429` configured rate limit or repeated authentication failures
- `500` inference, conversion, deletion, or internal runtime failure
- `503` no model is available or readiness is temporarily blocked

Responses include an `X-Request-ID`. Safe client-supplied IDs are preserved; invalid
values are replaced to prevent log injection.

## Automated validation profiles

```bash
python scripts/validate_api_contract.py --profile core
python scripts/validate_api_contract.py --profile openwebui
python scripts/validate_api_contract.py --profile n8n
python scripts/validate_api_contract.py --profile full
```

The `full` profile covers both external-client request shapes, streaming cancellation,
optional embeddings, optional benchmarks, and optional lifecycle exercise. The
validator records metadata and assertions only. It does not save prompts or model
output.
