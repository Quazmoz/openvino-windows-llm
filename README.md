# OpenVINO Windows LLM

## Video walkthrough

[▶ Watch the OpenVINO Windows LLM walkthrough](https://youtu.be/rya6rJhkQrw)

**OpenVINO Windows LLM turns Intel Windows PCs into local AI workstations.** It wraps OpenVINO GenAI in a Windows-first, OpenAI-compatible server with streaming chat, model conversion and lifecycle management, CPU/GPU/NPU targeting, hardware benchmarking, a built-in browser UI, and a deterministic mock engine.

The project keeps OpenVINO as the inference runtime. It does not require Docker, cloud inference, Electron, or a Node frontend toolchain.

> **Validation status:** Mock-mode tests validate API, UI, packaging, and state contracts. Real CPU, GPU, and NPU claims require the Windows certification harness on suitable hardware with mock mode disabled. An unsigned development installer is not a signed production release.

## Latest release — 0.6.0 (stable)

**Current stable version: `0.6.0`.** This release qualifies the OpenVINO / OpenVINO GenAI / OpenVINO Tokenizers `2026.2.1` stack and records the first real Intel CPU, GPU, and NPU certification evidence.

Downloads (GitHub release `v0.6.0`):

- [Portable ZIP](https://github.com/Quazmoz/openvino-windows-llm/releases/download/v0.6.0/OpenVINO-Windows-LLM-0.6.0-windows-x64-portable.zip)
- [SHA-256 checksums](https://github.com/Quazmoz/openvino-windows-llm/releases/download/v0.6.0/OpenVINO-Windows-LLM-0.6.0-checksums.txt)

References: [compatibility matrix](docs/COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md) · [public certification evidence](docs/certification/0.6.0/)

**Validation scope.** All evidence comes from a single Intel Core Ultra 9 185H laptop (Windows 11 build 26200) running OpenVINO `2026.2.1`. TinyLlama 1.1B, SmolLM2 135M, and Qwen2.5 1.5B — all FP16 — passed the full API contract on CPU, GPU, NPU, and AUTO, and BGE-Small embeddings passed on CPU. This is not a claim of support for all Intel systems.

> ⚠️ **The installer and portable ZIP are not Authenticode-signed.** Windows SmartScreen will warn on first launch. Verify your download against the published SHA-256 checksums before running.

Support remains specific to your hardware, model, driver, and OpenVINO version: a PASS on the machine above does not guarantee the same result on other Intel CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, drivers, or OpenVINO releases.

## Download → Install → Choose recommended model → Chat

The P0 desktop distribution is a thin Windows launcher around the existing FastAPI server and browser UI.

1. Download a versioned portable ZIP or installer artifact.
2. Run `OpenVINOWindowsLLM.exe` from the extracted package or Start Menu.
3. Review the hardware and OpenVINO system scan.
4. Confirm whether an Intel NPU is usable or select the offered CPU/GPU fallback.
5. Accept the conservative model recommendation or choose another compatible model.
6. Confirm license, disk, and warning information before download.
7. Follow separate download, conversion, validation, compilation, loading, and benchmark stages.
8. Continue directly to chat and copy the actual OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

The launcher binds to `127.0.0.1`, safely selects an available local port, waits for liveness and readiness, opens the browser, and avoids duplicate instances. Model weights are downloaded separately and are not included in the base installer.

The first model setup can take significant time. NPU support depends on the actual Intel platform, driver, model, and OpenVINO release. A requested device is not proof of execution. The wizard reports the actual device from successful measured generation.

## Installation options

### Windows installer

The Inno Setup configuration installs per-user under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\OpenVINOWindowsLLM`, creates a Start Menu shortcut, optionally creates a desktop shortcut, and preserves models and user data by default during upgrades and uninstall.

See [Windows installer guide](docs/INSTALLER.md).

### Portable ZIP

Extract the ZIP to a writable directory and run `OpenVINOWindowsLLM.exe`. Portable mode stores mutable data under a sibling `data` directory.

See [portable package guide](docs/PORTABLE.md).

### Source/developer setup

Windows remains the primary source-development target:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Quazmoz/openvino-windows-llm.git
cd openvino-windows-llm
.\setup.bat
.\start_server.bat --mock
```

For a real converted model:

```powershell
.\start_server.bat `
  --model tinyllama-1.1b-chat-fp16 `
  --device CPU `
  --auto-convert
```

Use `NPU`, `GPU`, or `AUTO` only when OpenVINO reports the target:

```powershell
.\start_server.bat --check-devices
```

## Visual preview

Screenshots were captured with the mock engine. On real Windows hardware, device status reflects the active OpenVINO target.

## Data paths

Installed mode uses:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenVINOWindowsLLM
```

Portable mode uses:

```text
<portable directory>\data
```

Configuration, logs, models, Hugging Face cache, OpenVINO compiled cache, benchmarks, diagnostics, and onboarding state are separated. Normal upgrades and uninstall preserve this data unless the user explicitly requests removal.

Existing environment overrides remain supported:

```text
OV_LLM_DATA_DIR
OV_LLM_MODELS_FILE
OV_LLM_MODELS_DIR
OV_LLM_CACHE_DIR
OV_LLM_BENCHMARK_RESULTS
```

See [mutable data paths](docs/DATA_PATHS.md).

State-changing routes follow the existing API-key policy when `OV_LLM_API_KEY` is configured. Connection examples never return the actual secret.

## Configuration

```powershell
$env:OV_LLM_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
$env:OV_LLM_PORT = "8000"
$env:OV_LLM_DEVICE = "CPU"
$env:OV_LLM_MODEL = "tinyllama-1.1b-chat-fp16"
$env:OV_LLM_AUTO_CONVERT = "1"
$env:OV_LLM_API_KEY = ""
$env:OV_LLM_CORS_ORIGINS = ""
$env:OV_LLM_RATE_LIMIT = "0"
$env:OV_LLM_MOCK = ""
$env:HF_TOKEN = ""
```

Keep the host at `127.0.0.1` unless LAN access is deliberate and protected. The server is not a hardened public gateway.

## Device behavior

Simple targets:

- `CPU`
- `GPU`
- `NPU`
- `AUTO`

Accepted advanced examples include `AUTO:NPU,GPU,CPU`, `MULTI:NPU,GPU,CPU`, and `HETERO:NPU,GPU,CPU`. Composite routing is experimental and does not guarantee additive performance.

OpenVINO discovery is the source of truth. Real support claims require the Windows certification harness.

## Model catalog

`models.json` describes model source, OpenVINO backend, output path, precision, recommended device, context, output limits, and remote-code policy. Catalog recommendations are starting points, not certification.

The desktop distribution copies the bundled catalog into writable configuration. Existing user entries are retained during upgrades. New entries use the writable model directory. Existing models are not silently moved or deleted.

## Build and validate a Windows distribution

```powershell
.\scripts\build_windows_distribution.ps1
.\scripts\smoke_test_packaged.ps1 -DistributionPath .\dist\OpenVINOWindowsLLM
```

The build script produces a versioned portable ZIP and, when Inno Setup is available, a per-user installer. It generates SHA-256 checksums and labels unsigned builds accurately.

The packaged smoke test uses mock mode and verifies startup, readiness, static UI, onboarding, model preparation, benchmark, Chat Completions, Responses API, streaming, portable paths, and controlled shutdown. It does not validate real CPU, GPU, NPU, model conversion, or Authenticode signing.

## Development and testing

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest
```

External mock contract validation:

```bash
OV_LLM_MOCK=1 python -m app.server --mock --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8123 --model tinyllama-1.1b-chat-fp16
python scripts/validate_api_contract.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8123 --profile full --expect-mock --include-embeddings --run-benchmark --exercise-lifecycle
```

Real hardware evidence:

```powershell
.\scripts\validate_windows.ps1
```

## Experimental Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quazmoz/openvino-windows-llm.git
cd openvino-windows-llm
chmod +x setup.sh start_server.sh setup/*.sh setup/linux/*.sh
./setup.sh --minimal
./start_server.sh --mock
./start_server.sh --model tinyllama-1.1b-chat-fp16 --device CPU
```

Linux GPU and NPU support remains driver-dependent and experimental.

## Security and privacy

- localhost is the safe default
- state-changing routes can require the configured API key
- CORS is opt-in
- progress and errors sanitize secrets and full private paths
- onboarding does not persist prompts or chat content
- connection examples use placeholders instead of disclosing configured keys
- model and conversion work remains serialized
- incomplete new conversion output is not presented as valid
- no certificates, private keys, passwords, or signing secrets belong in the repository

Conversation data remains in browser localStorage and is not persisted by the server.
